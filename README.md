## Version Choice – Why 1.21.4?
Oraclecraft targets **1.21.4** as a sweet spot:
- **Not bleeding edge** – avoids mod breakage from latest updates.
- **Broad mod compatibility** – works with most modern Fabric mods.
- **Stable experience** – avoids experimental API churn.

Some older mods (like *Flow*) are not included due to version lock.
